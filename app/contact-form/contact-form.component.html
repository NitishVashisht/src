<!--this example shows how to use validations on forms along with what is form-control or form-group and what are control object-->

<!--even if we remove form-group class from our two divs it will not impact the view but then we will be having one formgroup
with two form controls (first name and comment fields) but by not removing form-group class or in present scenario we have two form groups
having one one control object each ,inside a one parent formgroup because angular applies ngForm directive to our <form> tag under the hood.
If we have not provided the ngForm directive explicitily also ngForm directive has an output property to raise the custom event ngSubmit
which by default gets binded with button in our form.

** f.value is kind of object that can be send back to server as value of our form 

** for bootstrap checkbox the input tag will be under label and div will have class as checkbox and input type will be checkbox

** <p>{{f.value | json}}</p> the json pipe will convert the f.value to json object format

question can nested form groups are possible ?? yes

** <select multiple  ngModel name="dropdownlist" id="dropdown"> here multiple property is used in case user want to do multiple selections from
  drop down list

** <select [multiple] ="input.valid"  ngModel name="dropdownlist" id="dropdown"> here mulitple property has been binded with value of 
  input.valid input stands for template variable of element lable with name comment and if its valid then only multiple selection is possible.


** <option *ngFor = "let i of contactMethods" value = "{{i.name}}">{{i.name}}</option>
here value is equal to name of itterator means it is a single value in html we can bind a single string value and cannot bind complex objects
to value it can either be id or name of object in  contactMethods array of objects, so we can only send one string back to server is needed
but what if we need to send back an object instead of one value in that object then that time we have to use attribute directive ngValue
<option *ngFor = "let i of contactMethods" ngValue = "{{i}}">{{i.name}}</option> in this wat we can send back complex objects as well
but in maximum cases there will be no point of sending back the object to server
